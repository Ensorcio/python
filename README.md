Creating various scripts to exercise the python skills.

### 1.1
Can query a single IP and output it to a JSON file.
## aws_instance_query.py
### 1.0
Read a CSV of Instance IDs and check to see if they are running in AWS.
## length.py
###1.0
Take a string or a file with data and calculate the length of the string(s). I originally started writing this out to detect Credit Card PAN lengths in a file. Might eventually incorporate other features into this script.
